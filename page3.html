We reserve the right to assume, at our expense, the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claims. If we assume such defense, we will be responsible solely for our legal fees in connection with such defense and all other losses, damages, liabilities, judgments, settlements, costs and expenses shall be your sole responsibility.</div><div><br></div><div>MISCELLANEOUS</div><div>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the access to or use of the Site. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. If any provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.</div><div><br></div><div>If you have questions or comments, please contact us at: marketing@rodinflash.com</div></div>
